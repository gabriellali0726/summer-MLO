        "1. XGBoost emerged as the best model, outperforming all other learners including LightGBM, Random Forest, and Extra Trees. It achieved the lowest validation error (val_loss ≈ 0.1405) and the highest validation R² score of 0.8595 after retraining.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Model improvement was rapid in the early iterations: LightGBM initially performed best in under 5 seconds, reducing error from 0.56 to 0.14. However, XGBoost surpassed it in later iterations with finer-tuned configurations.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Training time and model performance varied significantly:\n",
        "\n",
        "   -Fast models like LightGBM achieved solid performance quickly (within 10 seconds).\n",
        "\n",
        "   -XGBoost took more time (200 seconds) to explore deeper configurations (e.g., 658 estimators) but ultimately provided better accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. The dataset likely has strong signal strength, as multiple models achieved R² scores above 0.85. This suggests that the combination of demographic, physical, and experience-related features are predictive of the target (deadlift).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Feature interactions are likely complex: the fact that deep tree-based models like XGBoost performed best implies nonlinear relationships between features such as age, height, training history, and lifting performance."

The quickest model completed training in just 0.29 seconds with a validation loss of 0.2612, followed closely by two more lgbm models with training times of 0.35 and 0.36 seconds, and validation losses of 0.1531 and 0.1572, respectively. These results demonstrate LightGBM's excellent balance between speed and predictive accuracy, making it an efficient choice for structured data tasks."

This significantly reduces the need to write complex training logic from scratch. Compared to full-code solutions like FLAML or AutoKeras, H2O simplifies experimentation with minimal code. However, it still requires basic coding skills to prepare the data, call the AutoML functions, and interpret the results, which makes it low-code rather than fully no-code.\n",

        "Compared with the manually developed models from Assignments 1 and 2, both FLAML and H2O AutoML achieved higher validation scores. FLAML’s best model (XGBoost) reached an R² of 0.86, clearly outperforming my Assignment 1 Linear Regression (0.44) and Assignment 2 Linear Regression's accuracy of 0.9 on average. In terms of speed, while AutoML took longer end-to-end due to model exploration (198s for FLAML, approximately 5min for H2O), the per-model training time for the best learners (e.g., LightGBM on FLAML, GBM/XGBoost on H2O) was still relatively low. Overall, the accuracy gain justifies the extra AutoML search time.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this assignment, I used both FLAML AutoML and H2O AutoML to train models on the athletes dataset. FLAML allowed full-code control and efficient model search, while H2O provided a low-code interface with built-in feature ranking and leaderboard output. From the FLAML runs, the top 3 models by validation score were from XGBoost and LightGBM, achieving much lower validation loss than the manually tuned models in Assignments 1 and 2. The top features identified were 'howlong', 'experience', and 'gender', highlighting the strong relationship between training duration, background, and lifting performance. Models using only these top features still achieved comparable accuracy with faster training times. Overall, AutoML significantly improved both the model performance and development efficiency, demonstrating its value in a production ML workflow.\n",
